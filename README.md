# maxHeap
This is a dynamic max heap implemented in c.

This heap implements a heap by using a linked list of arrays. By using this 
technique over realloc, it will run a little faster and smoother. To link this 
file properly to your own project, you will have to add the math libray, for 
some of the indexing functions reuire pow().
